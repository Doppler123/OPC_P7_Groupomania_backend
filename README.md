To run the project, you need to follow first those instructions (and only then the instructions in the README file from the frontend directory)

In this backend directory, you need to run 2 commands:

1. ### `npm installs`

This command installs all the packages and dependencies that are needed

2. ### `npm run start`

This commands run the script to start the node server. The API will then be working.



As the API is started, you can now follow the instructions in the README file from the frontend directory.
